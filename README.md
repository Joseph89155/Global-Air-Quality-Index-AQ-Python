# 🌍 Global Air Quality Index (AQ) Analysis

## 🎯 Project Objective
To analyze global air quality data and identify key patterns, pollutants, and locations contributing to poor air conditions. The goal is to provide insights that support public health awareness and environmental policy decisions.

## 📌 Key Questions (KPIs)
- 🌫️ Which countries or cities have the highest AQI levels?
- 🚧 What are the most common air pollutants globally?
- 📈 How does air quality vary by region and over time?
- 🏭 Are there correlations between urbanization and poor air quality?
- 👥 Which populations are most at risk?

## ⚙️ Process
1. 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing or inconsistent AQI readings.
2. 🗂️ **Feature Engineering**: Grouped data by region, pollutant, and air quality bands.
3. 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Used bar plots, pie charts, and box plots to understand trends.
4. 🧰 **Tools Used**:
   - Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
   - Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Project Insight
- 🌆 Cities in South and East Asia reported the highest AQI values.
- 💨 PM2.5 and PM10 are the most prevalent pollutants across regions.
- 📉 Several countries have improving trends, while others show a rise in pollution hotspots.
- 🚸 Areas with high population density and traffic congestion tend to have worse air quality.

## ✅ Final Conclusion
This project highlighted major global air quality challenges, emphasizing the need for stricter emissions controls and sustainable urban planning. The findings serve as a resource for policy makers, environmental advocates, and public health professionals.
